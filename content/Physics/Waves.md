## Definitions
- **Wavelength** is the distance between equivalent points on two consecutive waves e.g. peak to peak.
- **Amplitude** is the maximum displacement of a point on the wave from its undisturbed (equilibrium) position.
- **Frequency** is the number of complete waves passing a given point per second (in $\text{Hz}$).
- **Time period** is the time taken for a complete wave cycle to pass through a point. This is the reciprocal of frequency.
- **Phase** of a wave refers to the stage of the wave cycle. Two waves are in phase when they have $0\,\text{rad}$ phase difference. They are in antiphase when they have $\pi\,\text{rad}$ phase difference.
- **Coherence** is where waves have the same frequency and a constant phase difference.
- **Path difference** is the difference between the distance travelled by two waves when they meet. A path difference of $n\lambda$ produces waves meeting in phase, while a path difference of $(n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$ produces waves meeting in antiphase.

## Standing waves
**Formation** of a standing wave:
- A **progressive wave** travels through the medium.
- The progressive wave **reflects** off a boundary e.g. the end of the medium.
- The two progressive waves travelling in opposite directions **interfere** to produce a standing wave pattern.
- Where waves meet in phase, **constructive interference** occurs, causing **antinodes** of maximum displacement to form.
- Where waves meet in antiphase, **destructive interference** occurs, causing **nodes** of minimum displacement to form.

When standing waves form in tubes and strings, **antinodes** always form at open ends, and **nodes** always form at closed ends (or where a string is held down).
#### Practical
- Use a resonance tube partially submerged in water
- Hold a tuning fork over the top and move the tube until resonance occurs.
- Measure the length for the first and second resonance frequencies.
- $\lambda = 2(L_2 - L_1)$

## Refraction
**Refraction** occurs waves move between two mediums that have different wave speeds, causing the wave to change speed and bend. If the wave travels faster in the new medium, it bends away from the normal, else if it travels slower, it bends towards the normal.
##### Refractive index
The **refractive index** is the ratio of the speed of light in two media. The absolute refractive index is the ratio of speed of light in a vacuum to that of the material.
$$\text{refractive index} = \frac{\text{speed in medium 1}}{\text{speed in medium 2}}$$
##### Snell's law
$$n_1\sin\theta_i = n_2\sin\theta_r$$
##### Huygen's wavelet model
A wave of light is made up of many smaller wavelets. As the wave reaches a boundary at an angle, the wavelets which reach first, slow down first, causing the wave to bend towards the slower wavelets.

## Diffraction
**Diffraction** is the spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture with a width on the same order of magnitude as their wavelength.
#### Double slit diffraction
The waves from each slit interfere with each other, producing a pattern of bright and dark fringes.
##### Angle equation
$$\sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$
##### Spacing equation
$$\frac{n\lambda}{d} = \frac{x}{L}$$
