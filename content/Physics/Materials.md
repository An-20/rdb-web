### Deformation
To change the shape of an object, two equal and opposite forces are required. **Tensile** forces stretch an object, causing extension, while **compressive** forces act towards the centre of an object.

In **elastic deformation**, a material temporarily changes shape, and regains its original shape after deforming forces are removed. In **plastic deformation**, a material permanently changes shape, and does not regain its original shape after deforming forces are removed.
### Hooke's law
For a material within its elastic limit, the force applied is directly proportional to the extension of the material. Past the elastic limit, there will be plastic deformation, causing permanent deformation.
#### Limit of proportionality
A point beyond which behaviour no longer conforms to Hooke's law. It comes at a lower extension than the elastic limit.
#### Elastic limit
A point beyond which the spring will no longer return to its original shape once the force is removed. It comes at a higher extension than the limit of proportionality.
#### Work done
When a material is deformed elastically, work is done and stored as elastic potential energy. The energy is equal to the area under a force-extension graph. If plastic deformation occurs, work is done to achieve the deformation by rearranging atoms into new permanent positions.
#### Hysteresis loop
The **hysteresis** loop in a loading-unloading force-extension graph has an area bound by two curves, which represents the work being done. This is transferred to thermal energy. Materials such as rubber exhibit this behaviour.
### Spring Combinations
#### Parallel
Springs in parallel share the load and have the same extension as a single spring with a combined spring constant:
$$k_p = k_1 + k_2$$
##### Derivation
$F_p = F_1 + F_2 \implies k_px = k_1x + k_2x \implies k_p = k_1 + k_2$
#### Series
Springs in series have the same force. The extensions add, giving the same extension as a single spring with a combined spring constant:
$$\frac{1}{k_s} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}$$
##### Derivation
$x_s = x_1 + x_2 \implies \frac{F}{k_s} = \frac{F}{k_1} + \frac{F}{k_1} \implies k_s = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}$

##### Stress
**Stress** is the force applied per unit cross-sectional area. It is measured in pascal (Pa). Where $F$ is force, and $A$ is cross-sectional area:
$$\mathrm{Stress(\sigma)} = \frac{F}{A}$$
###### Yield stress
The stress required to cause the material to begin to deform plastically.
##### Strain
**Strain** is the extension or compression of a material per unit of its original length. It has no units, and is sometimes written as a percentage. Where $x$ is change in length, and $L$ is original length:
$$\mathrm{Strain(\epsilon)} = \frac{x}{L}$$
##### Young's modulus
The **Young's modulus** of a material is the ratio of stress to strain. It is the gradient of a stress-strain graph, and is a measure of stiffness. It is measured in Pascal (Pa).
$$\mathrm{YM} = \frac{\mathrm{stress}}{\mathrm{strain}}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = \frac{FL}{ax}$$
Materials definitions:
- **Stiff**: Small extension per unit force (high Young modulus).
- **Elastic**: Returns to unstretched form when stresses are removed.
- **Plastic**: Permanent deformation. 
- **Ductile**: Can be drawn into wires.
- **Hard**: Resists indentation on impact.
- **Brittle**: Undergoes little/no plastic deformation before fracture.
- **Tough**: Absorbs a lot of energy (deforms plastically) before fracture.
- **Strong**: Can withstand high stresses.

## Stress-strain Graphs
###### Young's modulus
The Young's modulus is the gradient of the straight part of a stress-strain graph.
###### Elastic limit
The elastic limit is where elastic deformation ends and plastic deformation begins to occur (at the yield stress).
###### Yield point
A point at which there is a large increase in the extension when the stress increases beyond the elastic limit.
###### Ultimate tensile strength
The maximum stress experienced by a sample before breaking.
##### Breaking point
The point at which the material breaks (at the fracture stress).
###### Area under graph
The area under a stress-strain graph is the toughness (energy absorbed per unit volume).

## Material structure
###### Crystalline
**Crystalline** structures have regular, ordered particles.
###### Amorphous
**Amorphous** structures have random and disordered arrangements.
###### Polycrystalline
**Polycrystalline** structures have regular crystalline fragments (grains), but the grains are arranged in a disordered way.

### Metals
Metals have a **crystalline** or **polycrystalline** structure.
##### Elasticity
Metals behave elastically for small strains. Up to the elastic limit, the spacing between positive ions increases. When the tensile force is removed, the metal returns to its original shape.
##### Malleability and ductility
Metals are **malleable** and **ductile**. There are **dislocations** - missing ions in the regular lattice arrangement. These allow atoms to move along one at a time, causing the dislocation to move through the metal, causing ductility and plastic behaviour. As dislocations move, **slips** can occur, where some layers require less force to move.
##### Alloys
In an alloy, there are other metals, and these ions are different sizes, pinning the dislocation and making slips more difficult.

### Amorphous materials
**Amorphous** materials such as glass are brittle. This is because cracks can easily propagate. Two atoms are pulled apart at a crack, followed by the next two atoms. The atoms cannot move relative to each other - they are pinned in place, and the crack area is small, producing high stresses. This causes the crack to quickly grow.

### Polymers
**Polymers** are long chains of repeating monomers. Chains are **entangled** and when stresses are applied, they **rotate** and **unravel** around each other. **Crosslinks** between chains can reduce the rotation and unravelling of chains.

### Bonding
Bonds in **ceramics** are **directional**, making it harder for them to deform plastically, while bonds in **metals** are **non-directional**.

## Atomic diameter
Rayleigh's oil drop experiment compares the diameter of an oil drop to the diameter of the oil layer floating on water. The assumptions are:
- The oil spreads out as far as possible.
- The thickness of the layer is equal to the length of one oil molecule.

For an oil layer of radius $R$ and oil drop of radius $r$, the length of one oil molecule $h$ is given by:
$$\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \pi R^2 h \implies h = \frac{4r^3}{3R^2}$$
