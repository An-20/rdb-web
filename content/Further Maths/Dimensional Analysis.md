The **dimensions** of a quantity describe the type of quantity being measured. For example, any distance or length, regardless of units, has the dimension of length, which has the symbol $\text{L}$. This can be written as $[\text{distance}] = \text{L}$.

There are three base dimensions in mechanics:
- **Length**, denoted $\text{L}$
- **Mass**, denoted $\text{M}$
- **Time**, denoted $\text{T}$

A **scalar** quantity has only magnitude (e.g. speed), whereas a **vector** quantity has both magnitude and direction (e.g. velocity). Vector quantities have the same dimension as their scalar equivalents (e.g. $[\text{speed}] = [\text{velocity}] = \text{LT}^{-1}$)

When **adding** and **subtracting** quantities, only quantities with the **same dimensions** can be added or subtracted. The resulting sum or difference has the same dimensions. For **products** or **quotients** the dimensions are multiplied or divided.

A **dimensionless** quantity has dimensions of $\text{M}^{0}\, \text{L}^{0}\, \text{T}^{0} = 1$, where all of the dimensions cancel out. 
- Many **coefficients**, such as the coefficient of restitution,  are dimensionless. 
- **Pure numbers**, such as $2$ and $\pi$ in $C = 2\pi r$, are dimensionless. 
- **Angles** have units but are dimensionless.
- **Trigonometric functions** are dimensionless as they are the ratio of two quantities with the same dimensions.

Dimensional analysis can be used to **predict formulae**, by equating the dimensions on both sides of a proposed formula. Dimensional analysis can also be used as an error check to see if a formula makes physical sense.
